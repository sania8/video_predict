# 🎥 Video Frame Extractor & Object Tracker

Welcome to the **Video Frame Extractor & Object Position Predictor** – a powerful and intuitive web application built to extract frames from videos and predict object positions within them using advanced machine learning techniques. Use the app -> https://video-predict.streamlit.app/

Developed with ❤️ at **Murthy Labs (https://www.murtylab.com/)**, this tool helps researchers and developers quickly analyze motion, behavior, and object tracking across video frames.

## 🚀 Features

- 📁 **Upload Single or Multiple Videos** (supports `.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mov`, `.mpeg4`)
- 🎞️ **Custom Frame Rate Extraction** – Choose how many frames per second to extract
- 🧠 **Object Position Prediction** – Get the location of detected objects per frame
- 📦 **Batch Upload** – Supports zip file uploads for multiple videos
- ⚙️ **Simple & Interactive UI** – Built with Streamlit for seamless usability

---

## 🧑‍🔬 How to Use

1. **Upload your video(s)** using the file uploader.
   - If uploading multiple videos, compress them into a `.zip` file.
2. **Select your desired frame rate** (frames per second).
3. **Click 'Extract Frames'** to process the video(s).
4. 🎯 The app will:
   - Extract frames from each video
   - Run object detection or tracking
   - Return the predicted positions of detected objects
